/**
 * <P>The base interface from which all GL profiles derive, providing
 * checked conversion down to concrete profiles, access to the
 * OpenGL context associated with the GL and extension/function 
 * availability queries as described below.</P>
 *
 * <P> While the APIs for vendor extensions are unconditionally
 * exposed, the underlying functions may not be present. The method
 * {@link #isFunctionAvailable} should be used to query the
 * availability of any non-core function before it is used for the
 * first time; for example,
 * <code>gl.isFunctionAvailable("glProgramStringARB")</code>. On
 * certain platforms (Windows in particular), the most "core"
 * functionality is only OpenGL 1.1, so in theory any routines first
 * exposed in OpenGL 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, 1.5, or 2.0 as well as vendor
 * extensions should all be queried. Calling an unavailable function
 * will cause a {@link GLException} to be raised. </P>
 *
 * {@link #isExtensionAvailable} may also be used to determine whether
 * a specific extension is available before calling the routines or
 * using the functionality it exposes: for example,
 * <code>gl.isExtensionAvailable("GL_ARB_vertex_program");</code>.
 * However, in this case it is up to the end user to know which
 * routines or functionality are associated with which OpenGL
 * extensions. It may also be used to test for the availability of a
 * particular version of OpenGL: for example,
 * <code>gl.isExtensionAvailable("GL_VERSION_1_5");</code>.
 *
 * <P> Exceptions to the window system extension naming rules:
 *
 * <UL>
 *
 * <LI> The memory allocators for the NVidia vertex_array_range (VAR)
 * extension, in particular <code>wglAllocateMemoryNV</code> /
 * <code>glXAllocateMemoryNV</code> and associated routines. {@link
 * #glAllocateMemoryNV} has been provided for window system-independent
 * access to VAR. {@link #isFunctionAvailable} will translate an argument
 * of "glAllocateMemoryNV" or "glFreeMemoryNV" into the appropriate
 * window system-specific name. </P>
 *
 * <LI> WGL_ARB_pbuffer, WGL_ARB_pixel_format, and other
 * platform-specific pbuffer functionality; the availability of
 * pbuffers can be queried on Windows, X11 and Mac OS X platforms by
 * querying {@link #isExtensionAvailable} with an argument of
 * "GL_ARB_pbuffer" or "GL_ARB_pixel_format".
