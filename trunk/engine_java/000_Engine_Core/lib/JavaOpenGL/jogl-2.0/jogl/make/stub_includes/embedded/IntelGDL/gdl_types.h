/** @ingroup plane_management
    This enumeration defines the various attributes that may be implemented by
    a hardware plane.  These values are used in three different ways:

    - to determine plane capabilities\n\n
      The function gdl_plane_capabilities() returns a plane capability array.
      To determine if an attribute is supported by the plane, use the
      corresponding enumeration value as an index into the array.  If the
      indexed entry is non-zero, the attribute is supported; otherwise it isn't.

    - to configure a plane\n\n
      The various set functions (e.g., gdl_plane_set_int()) allow the setting
      of individual attributes of the plane by specifying attribute name-value
      pairs.  The "names" in these pairs are members of this enumeration.

    - to examine the configuration of a plane\n\n
      The various get functions (e.g., gdl_plane_get_int()) allow the current
      value of an attribute to be queried by name.  The "names" used in these
      queries are members of this enumeration.

    The descriptions of the individual enumerated values contain the following
    fields:
    - @b Capability: what a non-zero entry in the corresponding entry of
         the capabilities array indicates.\n
    - @b Attribute: what the attribute controls.\n
    - @b Value: the data type of the attribute, which determines which get/set
         function should be used to manipulate it.  Where relevant, the
         range of legal values for the attribute is listed.  Note that
         enumerations are treated as uint values with a range restricted by the
         enum definition.
    - @b Default: the default setting of the attribute when the system is
         powered up.

    On the Intel CE Media Processors, the capabilities supported by the planes
    are as follows:
    - All planes:
        - #GDL_PLANE_ALPHA_GLOBAL
        - #GDL_PLANE_ALPHA_PREMULT
