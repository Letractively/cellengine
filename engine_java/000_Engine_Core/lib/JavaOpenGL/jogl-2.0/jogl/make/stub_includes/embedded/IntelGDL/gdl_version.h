 * GDL VERSION NUMBERS
 *
 * We currently maintain two types of version information:
 *
 * GDL version
 *      This varies with major redefinitions of the user API. It comprises:
 *        - a 4-bit major version number
 *        - a 16-bit minor version number, and
 *        - a 4-bit hotfix number (which will normally be 0).
 *      These numbers are determined by the #define's below.  Hotfix numbers
 *      should be incremented for each hotfix release, and should be reset to 0
 *      when one of the other numbers is rolled.
 *
 *      An application can retrieve the version number via the
 *      gdl_get_driver_info() API.
 *
 * Header version
 *      It is possible for internal changes to be made to shared header files
 *      resulting in incompatibility among the following components if they
 *      are built with different versions of the header files:
 *          - user applications
 *          - libgdl.so
 *          - gdl_mm.ko
 *          - gdl_server
 *
 *      The header version number is composed of 16-bit major and minor numbers
 *      assigned via the #define's below.  THE MINOR NUMBER SHOULD BE ROLLED
 *      whenever a backward-compatible change is made.  THE MAJOR NUMBER SHOULD
 *      BE ROLLED whenever changes are made that are incompatible with previous
 *      versions of the user library.
 *
 *      Compatibility is checked in gdl_init().
 *
 *      The header version is also returned via the gdl_get_driver() API.
