/**
 * Provides the mechanism by which the graphics configuration for a
 * window can be chosen before the window is created. The graphics 
 * configuration decides parameters related to hardware accelerated rendering such
 * as the OpenGL pixel format. <br>
 * On some window systems (EGL/OpenKODE and X11 in particular) it is necessary to
 * choose the graphics configuration early at window creation time. <br>
 * Note that the selection of the graphics configuration is an algorithm which does not have
 * strong dependencies on the particular Java window toolkit in use
 * (e.g., AWT) and therefore it is strongly desirable to factor this
 * functionality out of the core {@link NativeWindowFactory} so that
 * new window toolkits can replace just the {@link
 * NativeWindowFactory} and reuse the graphics configuration selection
 * algorithm provided by, for example, an OpenGL binding.
